"# stringtesting" 

In this program we used string methods

I creat  a datatype for strings to store the details like first name , last name and some other details from the user. to find length, compare two strings , etc. but user didn't give values to the datatype. then they could not find to show anything so error is occuring. i attach that screenshot given below.
